Welcome back. I'm Nan Jokerst and this is an in-depth video about vacuum deposition of thin films.
0:21
We use vacuum systems to deposit thin layers of materials such as metals and insulators onto our substrates. The thicknesses of these vacuum-deposited layers are very thin, on the order of 5 nanometers to 250 nanometers. The three most common thin film vacuum deposition techniques are thermal evaporation, electron beam evaporation and sputtering.
0:49
In this video, I will introduce you to the process of thermal evaporation.
0:55
Vacuum systems are used to deposit thin layers of ultra high purity materials onto our samples and substrates because air molecules that are present during deposition will become impurities in our deposited films. So we remove the air from the chamber in which we are doing the film deposition using vacuum pumps.
1:20
So vacuum deposition is any process in which a thin layer of material is deposited onto a surface in a high vacuum environment.
1:31
As shown in this animation, the atoms come from an ultra high purity material that we call the source. And atoms from this source travel through the vacuum in the vacuum chamber and are deposited onto the surface of our substrate.
1:49
This process is called physical vapor deposition or PVD,
1:55
and requires vacuum environments with pressures on the order of 10 to the minus 6 torr, or equivalently, 1.3 times 10 to the minus 4 pascals. We also require high purity source materials, typically 99.999% pure, five nines, or even better. These high purity materials include metals such as gold or aluminum, or an insulator or dielectric, such as silicon dioxide or silicon nitride. These are available by purchase from many sources. The first of the three PVD techniques is known as thermal evaporation. Thermal evaporation uses heat to evaporate the ultra high purity source so that it goes from solid to liquid to gas. The gas atoms travel through the vacuum in the vacuum chamber, and when these atoms hit the substrate, they condense and form a thin film on the surface of the substrate. You can use an everyday example to understand thermal evaporation. In this example, heat is used to melt ice into water, and the water is heated to the point of evaporation. The water vapor, which is now in the gas state, travels to the surface of the lid, at which point the vapor contacts the cooler surface and condenses.
3:20
Metals and dielectrics can both be deposited using this vacuum thermal evaporation technique. But thermal evaporation is typically used most for metals, since metals melt at pretty low temperatures and produce very steady deposition rates. To conduct a thermal evaporation, a small amount of our source material is placed into a container called a boat. The boat is heated by passing a large electrical current through it to heat it up in a process called resistive heating.
3:55
The boats that we use are typically tungsten.
3:58
Why tungsten?
4:00
If we want to melt a metal, its container, the boat, must remain intact during heating. That is, it shouldn't melt along with the source. And we need to conduct a large amount of current through this boat as well. So we use tungsten boats because tungsten has a higher melting point than our source metals, and it's very electrically conductive, allowing resistive heating to occur.
4:28
Let's look at the mechanics of thermal deposition. The tungsten boat is clamped between two electrodes. An electric current as high as several hundred amps passes through that tungsten boat, which undergoes resistive heating. Just like an incandescent light bulb filament, it heats up and glows. As the boat heats up, the metal source material in the boat melts, and then evaporates. These evaporated metal atoms travel through the vacuum chamber, strike the surface of the substrate, and condense, forming our thin layer of the source material on our substrate.
5:09
Here's another good question. When should we stop depositing our source material onto the substrate?
5:17
Well, we typically have a target thin film thickness for each of our processes that we conduct. So that means that we want to monitor the thickness of our deposited film on that substrate in real time during the deposition. So to monitor this film thickness, we place a crystal sensor in the vacuum chamber so that the source material is deposited onto the sensor at the same rate as onto our substrate. This crystal sensor vibrates. And the vibration frequency changes as the film is deposited onto the crystal, enabling us the sense this change in vibration and calculate that deposited film thickness as the deposition is taking place in real time.
6:03
When the desired thickness is reached, we stop the flow of electrical current through the boat, which stops the heating of the source and halts the deposition.
6:15
Thermal evaporation is one thin film vacuum deposition option. Be sure to look at the electron beam evaporation and sputter deposition videos to learn about two other commonly used thin film vacuum deposition techniques.
### Thermal Evaporation: Sample Deposition Demonstration, learners will be able to:
Hello, I'm Nan Jokerst at Duke University and I'm joined by my Ph.D. student, Aditi. Hey, Nan. In this video, Aditi will demonstrate the operation of the thermal evaporator. The fabrication tools, including thermal evaporator, are located inside the clean room. So, first we have to gown up to enter the clean room. We are now wearing the proper attire to enter the clean room. Let's go. The thermal evaporator is used to deposit thin films of materials onto the surface of a substrate or sample. Thermal evaporation is one of several methods for depositing thin films. The deposition method used will depend on a number of factors including the specific material being deposited, how much material is available, and even the resulting subtle differences and microstructure of the deposited film which can vary with the deposits and method used. Today, we will demonstrate thermal evaporation using a small amount of gold source material. We will use a silicon wafer as our sample. This is a thermal evaporator. Let's open the door to the vacuum chamber. To do this, we need to force-spring the vacuum chamber to atmospheric pressure which is called venting system. So, we open the control panel. You can think of this as opening a vent that lets air into the system. We usually add nitrogen to the system when we vent the system to keep the chamber as clean as possible. The previous user unset process by pumping down the system and leaving the chamber under vacuum because that keeps the chamber cleaner too. Press the vent button. First, replace our wafer on the sample holder. The wafer is secured to the holder with springs. After securing the wafer to the holder, we are ready to place the wafer holder into the vacuum chamber. Okay. Let's open the system now. Here are the gaskets that provide the vacuum seal for the door when we pump down. Next, we need to place our source material into the sample boat. The source material is the material we wish to deposit. Today, we are evaporating gold. Gold is often used in electronics because it does not corrode or oxidize. We will use a tungsten boat to hold the gold since tungsten melts at a higher melting temperature than gold. The boat is held between two electrodes within the vacuum chamber. We install the boat by loosening these screws and placing the boat under the washers and tightening the screws down. We then place a small amount of gold in the boat. This is high-purity gold. See, the label shows us that it's 99.999% pure. We use high-priority materials because some materials are incompatible with certain processes on materials. Even a small amount of unwanted material can ruin a device. Via the sample holder to the vacuum chamber, we now have our source material in place as well as our wafer. During evaporation, the boat is heated using electrical current. The gold will melt and begin to evaporate. The evaporated metal will travel towards the wafer at the top of the chamber and condense on the surface of the wafer, forming a thin film of gold. We can actually measure the thickness of the gold film as it is being deposited using an instrument called a thickness monitor. This monitor uses a vibrating crystal connected to the electrical monitoring equipment. As more material is deposited, the vibration frequency of the crystal changes. The controller then calculates corresponding material thickness. The user can see in real time how much material is being deposited. Also note the vacuum boat at the rear of the chamber. This leads to the turbo pump. If you look closely, you can see the turbine fins. We are now ready to close the vacuum chamber and begin the pump-down sequence. First, we rough down the system down to a few torr. Then, we start the double-pump so that high vacuum can be achieved. The turbo pump uses a mechanical pump as a vacuum pump. After about 90 minutes, the pressure in the chamber is down to about five times ten raised to minus six torr. This is the level we need to be to ensure a high quality evaporated film. Now, we can start the evaporation process. This process is automated so the computer controls the heating of the boat and monitors the thickness using thickness monitor. To correctly sense the deposited material thickness, we need to enter what material we are depositing into the thickness monitor computer program as well as our desired thickness. Then, we simply select the desired recipe and press start. When the desired thicknesses is reached, the process is ended and the boat cools down. So, let's now begin the process. Shortly after pressing start, the current flowing through the boat has heated it red hot. The gold has melted and is now evaporating. As mentioned, we can view the thickness of the deposited film in real time with the thickness monitor. It only takes a few minutes to reach our desired thickness. In this case, we deposited 75 nanometers of gold. At this point, the automated process is halted and the boat is allowed to cool. We now must vent the vacuum chamber so that the door can be opened. This means we bleed nitrogen gas into the chamber until the pressure inside reaches atmospheric pressure. That is the same pressure in the room. After a few minutes of bleeding in nitrogen gas, the chamber is fully vented and we can open the vacuum chamber door and retrieve our wafer. Our wafer is now coated with 75 nanometers of gold. Let's look at our wafer before and after the gold deposition. We now close the vacuum chamber and pump it down so that it will be ready for the next to user. We keep all our vacuum systems pumped down when not in use. This ensures that they remain as clean as possible. I hope that you enjoyed the demo of thermal evaporation. Thank you for joining us today.
### E-Beam Evaporation: Basic Function, learners will be able to:
Hello, I'm Nan Jokerst, and this is our in-depth video about electron beam vacuum deposition of thin films. We use vacuum systems to deposit thin layers of materials, such as metals and insulators, onto our substrates. The thicknesses of these vacuum deposited layers are very thin, on the order of 5 nanometers to 250 nanometers. The three most common thin film deposition techniques are thermal evaporation, electron beam evaporation, and sputtering. In this video, I will introduce you to the process of electron beam evaporation also called e-beam evaporation. This technique is similar to thermal evaporation but the material is heated up a little bit differently. In thermal evaporation, electrical current is used to heat a boat so that the source material in the boat melts and evaporates. In electron beam evaporation, a stream of electrons or an electron beam is aimed at a high purity source material that we want to evaporate. This beam of electrons heats the material to its melting point and then evaporates the source material. This electron beam is well confined. And one of the advantages of e-beam evaporation is that we can rotate different source materials into the path of that electron beam. So that we can deposit multiple material sequentially without opening the vacuum system which is also called a breaking vacuum or venting. An e-beam evaporator has two main components. First is the electron source or electron gun which produces the beam of electrons. Second, the crucible is where the source material that we want to evaporate is contained. This is like the boat for thermal evaporation.
2:15
Here is a crucible with gold in it for the source material.
2:19
Contained within that electron gun is a filament, the source of the electrons. And magnets for focusing that electron beam and directing it towards the crucible.
2:31
The electron beam is generated by heating the metal filament to the point that it glows bright, about 2,500 degrees centigrade. At this temperature, electrons are so energetic that some of them leave the surface of the filament. These electrons are then accelerated toward the source material using a high voltage electrode. And a set of magnets steer and focus the beam onto the source material to be evaporated.
2:59
The power level can be to control by adjusting the filament current. This is very important, since some materials require lower power to melt and can burn at higher power, while others require higher power just to melt.
3:17
The source material is contained in a small crucible. Depending upon the material being evaporated, the crucible may be made of tungsten, copper, or even a ceramic for very high temperature deposition.
3:31
Because that electron beam is well confined in space, only a small area of the source material is heated. This means that there's room for multiple small source materials in the vacuum chamber. Systems that hold four materials are very common and they are called four pocket hearths. There are four crucibles that fit into the hearth, and each crucible can hold a different source material. So that you can have up to four layers of different materials deposited without breaking vacuum.
4:07
The hearth is a rotated holder of copper which is water-cooled. The water cooling prevents the crucible material from melting and mixing with the source material or with the hearth itself. In this configuration, several different materials can be deposited or sequential back and forth can also be deposited of multi-layer materials.
4:32
Electron beam evaporation is one thin film deposition option. Be sure to take a look at the thermal evaporation and sputter deposition videos to learn about two other commonly used thin film vacuum deposition techniques.
4:48
I hope you enjoyed this lesson. Thank you for joining me today.
### E-Beam Evaporation: Sample Deposition Demonstration, learners will be able to:
To keep the chamber clean, it is left under vacuum. So first, we vent the chamber and then we can open the door to the vacuum chamber and look inside.
0:24
This vacuum chamber uses a mechanical pump and a cryopump.
0:29
Here is the port that leads to the cryopump located under the vacuum chamber.
0:35
Of course, this valve is currently closed as we cannot expose the cryopump to room air.
0:42
The material we wish to evaporate is held in what is called the hearth. In this case, we want to evaporate gold. The gold is contained in a small metal crucible. This crucible is then placed in the hearth. This particular instrument can accommodate up to four different materials in the hearth.
1:03
The electron gun is located here. Remember, the electron gun is a source of the electron beam that heats the sample. And the sample is placed at the top of the chamber in this dome-shaped holder.
1:17
Like many thin film deposition instruments, this evaporator uses a thickness monitor, which is here. So, we can monitor the film thickness that is being deposited.
1:29
Let's hold our sample into the dome shape holder.
1:34
In this example, we will use a 50 mm diameter silicone wafer as our sample.
1:39
We place the wafer in the holder and secure it with the clips.
1:44
We reinstall the dome into the chamber.
1:47
We also must verify that our desired material is in the crucible.
1:52
Today we will evaporate gold, so we index to the gold crucible.
1:57
As we can see, there is gold in the crucible. It is solid now since it is room temperature, but during deposition, it will be heated so that it melts and evaporates.
2:08
Let's close the chamber and begin the automated pump down sequence.
2:13
Remember this vacuum chamber utilizes a cryopump. So, the pump down sequence using the mechanical pump to rough out the system to a few torr, then the cryopump is used to achieve high vacuum.
2:28
Here's the cryopump controller, indicating the temperature of the cryopump. We can see that it's currently at 11 degrees Kelvin, that's -262 degrees Celsius. It is within the normal operating range. We will let the system pump for the next hour or so and come back then. The system has been pumping for an hour and 30 minutes. The pressure in the chamber is less than 5 times 10 to the -6 torque which is the maximum pressure the system allows for evaporation.
2:57
So we are ready to evaporate our metal.
3:00
We can read the pressure on this digital gauge.
3:04
We can now begin the E-beam deposition process.
3:08
First we select a recipe. This tells the computer which material or sequencing materials that we want to deposit. We then enter the desired thickness. Here we enter 75 nanometers, and then press the start button to begin the process.
3:24
The process is automated, so the computer controls the electron beam power and time and monitors the thickness using the thickness monitor.
3:34
After a minute or so, the electron beam has heated the crucible enough that it begins to glow.
3:41
We can look through the glass view port into the chamber and see the glowing crucible.
3:46
At this point, the gold has melted. It will be heated a little more so that it readily evaporates. The thickness monitor will tell the computer when we've reached our desired thickness and the process will halt.
4:00
We can see the thickness monitor indicating the thickness in real time.
4:05
Okay, we've reached our desired thickness and the process has automatically stopped.
4:11
After a cooldown period of a few minutes, the system will allow us to vent the chamber.
4:17
Remember, venting the chamber means we bleed nitrogen gas into the chamber until the pressure in the chamber equalizes with the pressure in the room, at which point we can open the chamber door.
4:31
Let's vent the chamber now.
4:33
After a couple of minutes, the chamber pressure equals the room pressure. Now we can open the door.
4:40
Let's remove our wafer from the dome.
4:43
You can see the nice gold color film.
4:47
Here's the wafer before and after gold deposition.
4:51
Now we replace the dome, close the door, and pump down the system, so it's ready for the next user.
4:59
I hope that you've enjoyed the demo of E-Beam evaporation. Thank you for joining us today.
### Sputter: Basic Function, learners will be able to:
Hello, I'm Nan Jokerst and this is our in-depth video about sputter deposition of thin films in a vacuum system.
0:22
We use vacuum systems to deposit thin layers of materials such as metals and insulators on to our substrates. The thicknesses of these vacuum deposited layers are very thin on the order of 5 nanometers to 250 nanometers.
0:38
The three most common thin film vacuum deposition techniques are thermal evaporation, electron beam evaporation, and sputtering. And in this video I will introduce you to the process of sputter deposition.
0:52
Sputter deposition is usually simply called sputtering. Sputtering is an entirely different process compared to the other types of thin film deposition we cover in these videos which all use evaporation. Instead, sputtering uses energized atoms that hit the source which are the blue atoms. The source material is in the form of a flat plate which we call a target.
1:18
Those energetic atoms hit the target and propel source material atoms off of the target and into the vacuum system. These are the yellow atoms. Some of these source atoms, [SOUND] hit the target up here and become the thin film. The energetic atoms used in sputter deposition are created in a plasma. You've probably heard of those three common states of matter, liquid, solid, and gas. Well, plasma is a fourth state of matter. But don't let that scare you. We use plasmas in our everyday lives. One common use of plasma is in fluorescent lights. The plasma in a light bulb is used to generate light. In our sputter system we will use in argon plasma which has energetic argon atoms that hit the target and remove source material from that target.
2:12
Sputtering is performed in a vacuum system. And so after we load the target, and we load our substrate, we evacuate the chamber using vacuum pumps to about five times ten to the minus six tor.
2:26
Then we leak a small amount of argon gas into that vacuum chamber.
2:31
Argon will be the gas that forms the plasma. And argon is used because it's inert, it's not reactive, and will not result in unwanted chemical reactions during our process.
2:44
When the argon gas is in the chamber, we apply a high negative electrical voltage to the target. This high voltage is strong enough to strip an electron from the argon atoms close to the target. That means that the argon atoms are now ionized and each argon atom has a positive charge. These positive argon atoms are attracted to that negatively charged target and they have enough speed to [SOUND] physically knock off individual atoms of the target material. This is the sputtering process.
3:19
These sputtered atoms fly off in all directions including toward the substrate that we want to coat. And this process continues until the substrate is coated with the desired thickness of material.
3:32
Then we turn the voltage off on the target and the sputtering stops.
3:38
Sputtering is one thin film vacuum deposition option. Be sure to take a look at the thermal evaporation and electron beam evaporation videos to learn about two other commonly used thin film vacuum deposition techniques.
### Sputter: Sample Deposition Demonstration, learners will be able to:
Hello, I'm Nan Jokerst at Duke University, and I'll be joined in this video by my PhD student, Callie. >> Hi, Nan.
0:20
In this video, Callie will demonstrate the operation of the sputter deposition system. This fabrication tool is located inside a clean room. So let's get into our clean room suit and take a look at the sputter system. >> This is the sputtering system. This is the vacuum chamber, and positioned behind it out of sight, are the mechanical vacuum pump and the high vacuum turbo pump. So the right of the vacuum chamber are their electronics, which I will discuss in a minute.
0:48
When not in use, the vacuum chamber is kept under vacuum at low pressure to keep the inside of the vacuum chamber as clean as possible.
0:58
So the first step to use the sputter tool is to vent the chamber.
1:02
This means that a small valve is opened that lets nitrogen gas into the chamber.
1:07
Nitrogen is used, because it's clean and free of any moisture. We vent the chamber using the touchscreen.
1:15
It takes several minutes for enough nitrogen to fill the chamber, and let the chamber pressure equal the room pressure.
1:21
Then we can open the door to the vacuum chamber.
1:25
Now that venting is complete, we can open the vacuum chamber door.
1:30
As with any door, on the vacuum chamber, there must be some type of seal or gasket that seals the chamber airtight, so it can be pumped down to vacuum. You can clearly see the door gasket here.
1:42
Let's take a look inside the vacuum chamber of the sputter tool.
1:47
There are several interesting things to see in the sputter system vacuum chamber.
1:52
First, we have a port for the turbo pump. You can see the turbo pump turbine fends behind the protective screen
2:00
attached to the turbo pump. But hidden from view is a mechanical backing pump that assists the turbo pump. Next, we have a small port used to feed argon gas into the chamber. The argon will be ionized to form the plasma. The third component is the target, located under this movable shutter.
2:20
The target is the material we wish to deposit.
2:24
For example, this target is titanium. Note that this system has a three target capacity, so we can deposit up to three materials during a single sputtering process. The shutter can block sputtered material from the sample.
2:39
We can open and shut the shutter to quickly start and stop deposition to keep precise thicknesses.
2:46
When the shutter is closed, no deposition on the sample occurs. When the shutter is open and the plasma is on, then deposition occurs.
2:56
The shutter is needed because you cannot quickly turn on or off the plasma, as it can cause the target to heat or cool too quickly, and may crack the target material.
3:06
The shutter allows us to slowly increases spread of power, and slowly decreases spread of power without unwanted deposition onto the sample.
3:15
Attached to the target is an electrical lead used to bias the target with negative voltage.
3:21
This negative voltage is what ionizes the argon gas, and they attract the positively charged argon ions to the target surface, which then physically removes or sputters small amounts of the target material.
3:34
The next component is a sample or substrate holder, located at the top of the chamber.
3:40
This is where we put our substrate or sample that we will spread a deposit of thin film onto.
3:46
Here is the thickness monitor, which measures the thickness of the material being deposited in real time.
3:53
First, we remove the metal plate from the chamber.
3:57
Let's load our substrate into the vacuum chamber, so we can deposit a thin film of titanium onto it.
4:04
This is a silicon wafer we will use. Notice the color, this is pure silicon. Today, we will deposit a thin film of titanium onto the silicon.
4:14
We place our substrate on the metal plate, and hold it down with a small spring.
4:19
Then we return the metal plate to the chamber with our sample attached.
4:26
Let's double check that our desired source material target is in the chamber, and note the location. One, two, or three. In this case, titanium is in position one.
4:39
We set the control knob on the sputter system to target number 1. Now, let's close the door and pump down the chamber. To pump down, we select Pump on the computer touchscreen.
4:51
The computer controller will turn on the mechanical pump first, which will rough pump down the system to a pressure of a few torr.
4:59
Then the computer turns on the high vacuum turbo pump, which will pump the chamber to about five times ten to the negative six torr.
5:07
This is the vacuum level required by the system to do a sputter deposition. This will take about one and a half hours.
5:15
The system has pumped down to less than five times ten to the negative six torr, so we can now begin the sputtering process. First, we slow down the turbo pump to 45% of full speed. Because we will introduce small amounts of argon gas into the chamber, we don't want the turbo pump spinning at full speed, because it will remove the argon gas too quickly. Remember, argon is the gas that will ionize and cause the sputtering action.
5:42
Okay, the turbo pump speed and chamber pressure have stabilized.
5:46
We are nearly ready to begin deposition.
5:49
First, let's set up the thickness monitor for the desired material, in this case, we will deposit titanium.
5:56
The thickness monitor will display the deposited thickness in real time.
6:01
We are now ready to turn on the plasma, which is also called striking the plasma.
6:06
This is done by applying a high voltage to the target. And to do this, we turn on the power supply that applies the voltage.
6:14
The power applied is set on the controller. We must start at low power, and slowly raise the power to avoid hitting the target too quickly which may crack it.
6:23
The higher the power, the faster the source material is sputtered and deposited. The typical power ranges from 200 watts to 750 watts for this particular system, while the power that we start with is 100 watts.
6:38
Today, we will change the power slowly from 100 watts to 500 watts, and then we will open the shutter to begin depositing the titanium.
6:47
Let's get a close up view of the plasma through this port.
6:50
Okay, we have struck the plasma. Can you see the pink purple glow through the view port?
6:56
That is light being emitted from the plasma. The plasma creates the ionized argon atoms that accelerate toward the target.
7:03
As the ionized argon atoms hit the target, they knock off titanium atoms. This is what we call sputtering.
7:11
Once we strike the plasma, we slowly ramp the power from 100 watts to 500 watts.
7:16
When we get to 500 watts, we open the shutter, which allows the sputtered titanium atoms from the target to hit our sample mounted at the top of the chamber.
7:25
Let's get a close up view of the shutter opening.
7:29
Here, we are looking into the chamber at the plasma. The shutter is currently closed. We are now ready to open it and begin deposition.
7:38
With the shutter now open, we are deposing titanium atoms onto our sample located at the top of the chamber.
7:46
We can monitor the thickness using the thickness monitor.
7:50
When we reach our desired thickness, we will close the shutter to halt deposition.
7:56
So, we are nearing our target thickness of 75 nanometers. Okay, now, I'll close the shutter to stop deposition.
8:05
And now, we can slowly ramp the power back down.
8:09
After ramping down the power, we can turn off the power supply and the plasma goes away. With the plasma off, we turn off the argon gas flow, and set the turbo pump speed back to normal which is 100%. We are now ready to retrieve our sample. To do this, we vent the chamber just like at the start of the video. With the chamber now vented, we can open the door and take out our sample.
8:36
That's it, we've deposited a thin film of titanium onto our sample. Let's compare the wafer before and after titanium deposition.
8:49
The final step is to close the system and start the automated pump-down sequence. Remember that we leave the vacuum chamber under vacuum when not in use to keep it as clean as possible.
9:03
Thanl you for joining me for this demonstration of sputter deposition.
