### Self-Assembly

Welcome, my name is Carrie Donley. And I'm the Director Chapel Hill Analytical and Nanofabrication Lab, or CHANL, at UNC.

Today we will be talking about self-assembly, which is an important way in which molecules or nanoparticles can arrange themselves in ordered structures.
￼0:33
So what is self-assembly? Self-assembly happens when a disordered system forms an ordered structure because of specific interactions between the components. Often, but not always, this is the result of noncovalent bonds. DNA, the molecules that contain all of your genetic information, is an example of a molecule that is self-assembled. Each strand of DNA contains a backbone on which a sequence of four bases are attached.
￼1:04
The chemical structure of the bases are such that they will form hydrogen bonds with their complementary base pair. Guanine selectively binds to cytosine and adenine selectively binds to thymine.
￼1:17
To form the double helix structure, hydrogen bonds hold two complementary single strands of DNA together. This simple self-assembly process determines many of our physical characteristics. DNA self-assembly can be used to organize nanoparticles, as we'll see later. There are different types of forces that act on molecules. Those within a molecule are called intramolecular. They are generally pretty strong and include ionic and covalent bonds.
￼1:50
Other forces act between molecules. And these forces can be used to gather molecules into particular patterns during self-assembly. Common forces included in self-assembly include hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic/hydrophilic interactions, and pi-pi interactions between aromatic molecules. Let's look at a few examples of self-assembly. One of the most common types of self-assembly is self-assembled monolayers. The reaction of alkanethiols with a gold surface to form a self-assembled monolayer is one of the easiest ways to chemically modify a surface. The sulfur group, illustrated by the circle in the diagram and a SH in the sketch of the molecule, reacts with the gold to form a gold sulfur bond.
￼2:41
Initially, the first molecules to bind to the surface are fairly disordered and may even lie down on the surface of the gold. But as the surface coverage becomes more dense, the molecules will form an ordered and well-packed monolayer on the surface.
￼2:56
We can use X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy to look for the signal from the sulfur atoms to confirm that we've added a sulfur-containing molecule to the surface. The arrows show the expected signal from the sulfur atom. We can use a variety of molecules to create self-assembled monolayers. One end of the molecule must react with the substrate. And the other end can change the surface chemistry in a useful way.
￼3:23
Another example of a self-assembled monolayer is a trimethoxysilane attached to glass.
￼3:30
Another type of self-assembly is driven by how molecules interact with water. This is a lipid molecule which has one end that likes water and one that is repelled by water. This difference in how the ends of the molecules react with water makes them self-assemble. For example, cell membranes are made of a bilayer sheet of lipid molecules self-assembled so that the water-liking head faces outward and the water-repelling tails are hidden from the water inside the sheets.
￼4:05
Lipid molecules can also form spherical structures called micelles.
￼4:10
Soap molecules commonly form micelles in water and are able to surround dirt particles and wash them away.
￼4:18
Imagine trying to clean greasy dishes with water alone. It doesn't work very well, does it? Grease does not like to mix with water. But it will mix with the water-repelling tails in the soap micelle. Once the grease is inside the micelle, it can be washed away with water very easily, making it much easier to do the dishes. Scientists have also attached nanoparticles, represented by the spheres, to short strands of DNA synthesized in the lab, and use the self-assembly process to bring together different types of nanoparticles in an ordered manner. Here are a couple of examples of structures that were fabricated with this DNA self-assembly approach.
￼5:01
The structures were imaged with transmission electron microscopy, or TEM, to understand how the nanoparticles had self-assembled.
￼5:10
You can see how differences in nanostructures can be captured with TEM in these images.
￼5:17
Scientists hope that this type of self-assembly of nanoparticle arrays will allow them to design new materials with desired properties.
￼5:27
Scientists are also interested in assembling carbon nanotubes. Carbon nanotubes are formed by taking an atomically thin piece of graphite, similar to the graphite in your pencil, and rolling it into a tube. These nanotubes are known for being very strong and having good electrical properties. Scientists would like to use them in the next generation of transistors for our computers and smartphones. But they need to find a way to align them in the same direction and also pack a lot of them into a small space.
￼6:02
Scientists at IBM use a substrate with patterned lines consisting of hafnium oxide and silicon dioxide. The hafnium oxide regions were further patterned with a self-assembled monolayer that had a positive charge on it. The carbon nanotubes were modified so that they had a negative charge and would be attracted to the positively charged, self-assembled monolayer. These scanning electron microscope and atomic force microscope images show that they were successful in self-assembling and aligning the carbon nanotubes within these pattern lines. There are many techniques for self-assembly. And we've discussed just a few here. Scientists continue to come up with new ways to form small, ordered structures through self-assembly. And I can't wait to see what happens next.
