### Hot Embossing: Basic Function
Welcome. My name is Carrie Donley and I'm the director of the Chapel Hill Analytical and Nanofabrication Lab or CHANL at UNC. In this video, we will cover the basics of a fabrication technique called hot embossing. Hot embossing is a relatively simple fabrication technology that involves the use of heat and force to press a master mold into a polymer substrate. In this way, the inverse of the structures on the master are transferred into the surface of the opposing polymer substrate. Although the embossing process has been used for centuries to pattern macroscale structures on objects such as coins and paper, more recently, it has been used to replicate structures at the micro and nanoscale. For instance, hot embossing has been used for the production of CDs and DVDs, which have features as small as a few hundred nanometers. Hot embossing is also heavily used in the life sciences field to make microfluidic devices, which are basically miniaturized chemistry labs. The primary component of hot embossing is the master mold. The master mold only needs to be fabricated once but it can be used many times to replicate the same structure. While the fabrication of the master mold can be expensive and time-consuming, the replicated part takes only a few minutes to make and cost significantly less money. This makes hot embossing especially suitable for mass production. There are a variety of ways to fabricate a mold and the end-user must decide what mold properties are important such as lifetime of the mold, size of the features, and cost. One technique that is commonly used to fabricate molds is called micro milling. Micro milling uses a miniature drill bit to carve out structures to make a mold. Micro milling is great for making strong master molds that can be reused many times. However, it cannot be used to make very small nanoscale structures because the smallest drill bit is too large. The smallest structures this technique can make are limited by the geometry of the milled structure and the size of the drilling bit, which is about 25 microns. In order to make nanoscale structures with hot embossing, more advanced technologies are required for fabricating the master mold. So, what do we mold? Polymers. A type of polymer that people are familiar with is plastic. Plastics are used just about everywhere because they are inexpensive and easy to shape. Also, because there are so many varieties of polymers, they have a wide range of material characteristics. All of these properties make polymers very useful for making micro and nanoscale structures. Poly(methyl methacrylate) is shown here and is widely used because it is transparent and can be molded at lower temperatures than other substances. As the polymer is heated to be used for hot embossing, it changes from a hard brittle substance to become soft and flexible. As the polymer is heated further, it melts. The temperature at which the polymer becomes soft is called the glass transition temperature or Tg. As the polymer is heated above Tg, it becomes softer and can flow into the mold during the embossing process. Different polymers have different Tgs which need to be considered when determining what material will be used for hot embossing. Now, let's discuss the hot embossing process in a little more detail. The hot embossing process follows four main steps. Heating, embossing, cooling, and demolding. In the first step, the master mold and polymer substrate are heated independently in a vacuum chamber to a temperature just above the glass transition temperature of the polymer. The system is typically placed under vacuum to remove gases trapped in cavities between the mold and the substrate and to remove water vapor driven out of the polymer during the heating process. In the second step, the mold and substrate are pressed together with a controlled force. At this stage, force and temperature are kept constant over a defined amount of time. Force, temperature, and time are critical parameters for ensuring that the mold cavities and structures are completely filled by the polymer substrate. Once the embossing step is completed, the system is cooled below the Tg of the polymer where the polymer substrate returns to a rigid state. In the final step, the mold and polymer substrate are carefully separated from one another. This de-embossing or demolding step is usually the most critical step due to the large shear and friction forces that act on the polymer structures by the mold. Structures with vertical sidewalls and high aspect ratios are especially prone to deformation and require precise control of temperature, force, and position during demolding. When the embossed part is complete, the user may inspect the quality of the structures using an optical or electron microscope to determine if any embossing parameters require adjusting. Thank you for joining me for this video on hot embossing.
### Hot Embossing: Sample Patterning Demonstration

Hello, my name is Carrie Donley. I'm the Director of the Chapel Hill Analytical and Nanofabrication Lab, or CHANL at UNC. With me today is Nicole Smiddy. Nicole is a graduate student here at UNC. >> Hi, Carrie. >> Hi, Nicole.

>> So today, I will be demonstrating for you the hot embossing process which is a technique used to replicate structures in both the nano and micron scale. Here's the hot embossing system. It is basically an industrial sized press with temperature and force control. This is a particularly large system that is good for embossing over large areas.
￼0:52
These are the top and bottom plates of the embossing unit. They have heaters inside that allow the user to increase the temperature of the mold and the substrate. There are also cooling lines inside the plates that enable the system to cool down rapidly.
￼1:09
This embossing system can operate under vacuum. Here is the top and bottom of the vacuum chamber.
￼1:16
The master mold is attached to the top plate. The glass plate on the bottom creates an optically smooth surface on the back of the polymer substrate.
￼1:28
Before performing the embossing process, we need to prepare the system. First, we load the master mold. It's good to wear gloves because even fingerprints can get transferred to the substrate.
￼1:42
For this demonstration, we are going to use a grade of PMMA or polymethyl methacrylate, that has a glass transition temperature around 135 degrees Celsius.
￼1:56
It's always good to blow off the substrate with compressed nitrogen gas to remove any debris.
￼2:03
The substrate is then placed in the center of the bottom plate.
￼2:08
Now we are ready to set up the embossing process. The embosser is software controlled and the user can create recipes that define the embossing parameters and a sequence of commands for the system.
￼2:23
The three critical hot embossing parameters are force, temperature and time.
￼2:29
Let's set the embossing force to 10,000 Newtons. This corresponds to about 2,250 pounds of force. We want to raise the temperature of the substrate to above its glass transition temperature which is about 135 degrees Celsius. So let's set the embossing temperature to 145 degrees Celsius. Here, we will set the embossing time or hold time to two minutes.
￼3:01
Once the embossing step is complete, the substrate needs to be cooled down below the TG, so that it is rigid and won't deform during the demolding step.
￼3:13
Here, we will enter 80 degrees Celsius.
￼3:18
Now that our recipe has been created, we can run the process.
￼3:23
Here, the bottom of the system raises up to bring the top and bottom plates together until a vacuum seal is formed.
￼3:33
The chamber is evacuated and the system begins heating.
￼3:37
Here we can see the temperature starting to rise. Here there are four points where temperature is recorded. They correspond to the top and bottom plates, the mold and the substrate holder. Heating takes about five minutes. Once 145 degrees Celsius is reached on both the mold and substrate holder, the system begins applying force until it reaches 10,000 Newtons and the embossing step begins.
￼4:10
Here, you can see the force curve rapidly rising.
￼4:15
The embossing step lasts for two minutes while a constant force is maintained.
￼4:21
This particular mold has structures that are up to one millimeter tall.
￼4:27
Deeper structures may require longer hold times or greater force to fully emboss the substrate.
￼4:35
Once the embossing step is complete, the system begins cooling down until the tool and substrate reach 80 degrees Celsius.
￼4:46
Now that the polymer substrate has cooled down and has hardened, the chamber is vented, and the mold is separated from the substrate.
￼4:55
You can see a rapid decrease in the force applied to the system. Once the demolding step is complete, the system will open up, and separate the top or bottom plates. Here is the final embossed PMMA substrate. The total processing time took about 15 minutes.
￼5:16
This particular structure is part of a microfluidic device, and additional processing involves cutting out the patterns, sealing it with another piece of polymer, and making connections to the fluidic network inside the device.
￼5:32
That concludes our demonstration of the hot embossing system. Thank you for watching.
