### Ion Beam: Basic Function
Hello, I'm Roberto Garcia. I'm a lab manager at the Analytical Instrumentation Facility at NC State University. Part of the Research Triangle Nanotechnology Network. In this video, you will learn the basics of ion beams, which are used in many fabrication and analysis processes in nanotechnology. An ion beam is exactly what the name suggests. It's a beam of charged particles called ions. Ions are atoms or molecules that have a net electrical charge, meaning that they are not electrically neutral. If there are more positively charged protons than negatively charged electrons, the ion is called a cation, meaning it has a net positive charge. In the opposite case where there are more electrons than protons the ion has a negative charge and is called an anion.

You may not know much about ion beams, but you may be familiar with laser beams. Lasers produce a focused beam of light particles called photons. An ion beam is very similar. However, instead of providing photons, ion beams provide ions.
1:09
There's quite a few different ways that ion beams are used in nanotechnology. But let's go over the basic concept of how an ion beam is generated.
1:17
Ion beam systems are often used in precision applications. In order to get a focused beam of ions, the system is housed in a chamber that is under a vacuum in order to prevent collisions between the ions and air molecules. Most importantly, there is an ion source. This source contains a source material from which the ions will be generated. This source cannot produce ions indefinitely and will need to be replaced eventually. A high voltage supply powers the source and allows ionization to occur.
1:44
The ion beam is produced by an electric field that draws the ions into a flowing beam, which is directed towards the sample. In some equipment, scanning coils can be used to direct the beam in a pattern along the sample.
1:56
Remember that ions have a net positive or negative charge. This electric field must be opposite the charge of the ions to be accelerated.
2:04
This results in an ion beam which can be aimed towards a target sample. This is a simplified description of ion beam sources but all ion beam systems run on these principles. Systems will vary considerably depending on the application. Speaking of which, let's go over how ion beams are used in nanotechnology.
2:21
Ions are heavy, dense particles, much heavier than photons or electrons. They're accelerated fast enough towards a sample, where they can cause atoms and molecules in the target material to be removed. The use of ion beams to remove material is the basis of nanofabrication processes called sputtering, Ion etching, and ion milling. Primarily, these processes are physical in nature, meaning the ejection material is largely a result of the transfer of energy from the beam into the material. Ions can also chemically react with the surface material to cause etching to occur. Ion etching and milling is extensively used to create pattern surfaces on materials, such as trenches in modern semiconductor structures shown here. It can also be used to produce very thin samples of materials to be used in transmission electron microscopy, or TEM. In TEM, electrons must pass through the sample to generate an image. This requires a sample to be ultra thin, no more than a few hundred nanometers thick.
3:15
Ion mills and focused ion beams are great tools for reducing TEM samples from bulk materials. As part of the sputtering process, the ion beam will impact the material and essentially become embedded within it. This is called ion implantation. When an ion is implanted into a material, it can change these physical, chemical, or electrical properties of the original material. A common nanofabrication process using ion implementation techniques called doping is used in a variety of applications such as the production of semiconductor devices like LEDs or solar cells. As well as, improving the corrosion resistance of metals in tools like drill bits. Doping makes it possible to create electronics with unique properties. For example through ion implantation, a material can be made to emit light when a current flows through it, a property called electroluminescence, which is how a light emitting diode, or LED works. Ion implantation can also be used to make metals resistant to corrosion, friction and rust, a common feature needed in metal tools like drill bits. Ion beams are not only used in fabrication processes. They can also help characterize and analyze materials. Some microscopes can produce high resolution images using ion beams, similar to an electron microscope. These microscopes are also capable of using the ion beam to selectively remove material to look at cross sections of the sample. For example, with the help of an ion microscope, we are able to cut a cross-section of this fiber and collect images of its internal structure. In analysis applications, ion beams are primarily used to help determine the elemental or chemical composition of a material. When an ion beam interacts with a sample, the interactions can be observed and measured to help determine the composition of material. For example, in secondary ion mass spectrometry, an ion beam is accelerated towards a sample. Secondary ions are ejected from the material, which can be counted and analyzed to determine their origins and be used to determine what elements are present in the sample.
5:04
Ion beams are a very important tool in nano technology, making it possible to produce innovative materials like monitoring electronics, as well as helping us understand the properties of materials. Using ion beams, we can precisely control the architecture and composition of the materials at the nano scale. This concludes the introduction to ion beams, thanks for watching.
### Ion Beam: Milling and Sectioning Demonstration
Hello I'm Roberto Garcia, I'm a lab manager at the Analytical Instrumentation Facility at NC State University, part of the Research Triangle Nanotechnology Network. In this video, we will demonstrate capabilities of ion beams used in nanotechnology.
0:29
Ion beams are important tools in nanotechnology. They allow us to precisely create structures and patterns on materials at the nanoscale or embed ions within materials to change their properties. A very common use of ion beams in nanotechnology is a process called ion milling is primarily to prepare samples for Transmission of Electron Microscopy, or TEM.
0:50
In TEM, an electron beam is generated and accelerated through a sample. For this to be possible, the sample must be ultra thin so that electrons can fly through the sample.
1:00
When this happens it's considered electron transparent.
1:06
Generally speaking, a specimen needs to be around 100 nanometers thick or less to be electron transparent.
1:13
Ion beams are used to reduce the thickness of material by bombarding it with heavy ions and causing material to sputter away.
1:21
Today we will use a focused ion beam, abbreviated as FIB or often referred to as a FIB for TEM sample preparation.
1:30
The ion beam we will be using today is part of an FEI Quanta 3D dual beam microscope. It is called a dual beam microscope because it has two beams, both an electron beam and an ion beam. This is the electron column which generates an electron beam and accelerates the electrons towards the sample. This is the ion column which generates the ion beam and accelerates it towards the sample. It is mounted 52 degrees relative to the electron column.
1:57
This omniprobe here extends a very small needle inside the microscope which allows us to physically interact with the sample inside the chamber. Today we'll be using this system to make an ultra thin sample of a semiconductor component we examined in a TEM microscope. The bulk sample is mounted on a standard pin mount with this carbon tape. We use a to extract a thin specimen from a bulk sample. The omniprobe will be used to transfer it to a small metal grid which can then be placed into a TEM.
2:26
The TEM grid is loaded in a very small slot to the right of the pin mount.
2:32
We must vent the chamber so we can place our sample and TEM grid inside. The chamber's kept under constant vacuum to prevent contaminants from accumulating within the microscope. Once it has come up to atmospheric pressure, we can open up the chamber and place our sample in.
2:49
Place the sample and grid holder onto the stage, then tighten the set screw with a torque screwdriver to secure it in place.
2:57
Now we can close the chamber and pump it back down under vacuum.
3:02
Instruments that use ion or electron beams need to be inside a vacuum to produce a precise beam. For this system we need to wait until the pressure inside the chamber is below 5 times 10 to the -5 Torr.
3:14
While the chamber pumps down, let's go over the controls on the computer. This Graphical User Interface or GUI allows us to control pretty much everything the microscope does.
3:25
This top bar controls the beam and scanning conditions for the electron and ion guns.
3:30
The top left panel is the scanning electron microscope image generated by the electron beam.
3:36
The top right panel is the ion beam image.
3:40
The bottom right panel is an infrared light image of the chamber interior. You can see our sample here. On the right, there are more advanced controls for beam conditions as well as stage controls and controls for patterning with the ion beam and making measurements.
3:56
At the bottom right, there are real time status conditions including pressure within the chamber.
4:02
Now that we have sufficient vacuum, we can turn the beam on. Preparing a TEM sample in a system like this requires the use of many components including the electron beam, the ion beam, the omniprobe needle and metal deposition needle within the microscope. Each of these components approach the sample from different directions. They are optimized to precisely interact at a single point. This is called the centric position. In order to perform a TEM lift out, we start by tilting and raising the stage so our sample is at this eucentric position.
4:34
Now that the sample is at the eucentric position, the electron beam and ion beam are coincident meaning that they are both aimed at the same location on the sample.
4:44
So if we pause the SEM beam and unpause the ion beam, we will see the same area in both windows.
4:50
Now we find a region of interest from where we would like to remove a sample for TEM experiments.
4:56
Some materials are not entirely uniform so it is important to carefully consider which region you want to remove a specimen from. We will be removing a specimen from this area here.
5:07
Let's get started.
5:09
First we will deposit a small amount of platinum to protect the area of interest. Any time the ion beam is on, it will be removing material from the sample. By depositing a small amount of platinum, we can protect our region of interest while we remove material from adjacent areas.
5:25
To do this, we use the patterning controls to draw a box and place it over our region of interest.
5:31
Next we insert the platinum deposition needle.
5:35
Now we click the start patterning button to begin depositing platinum.
5:39
We can program the SCM image to update every few seconds to see the progress of the platinum deposition.
5:45
Platinum deposition is now complete so we can retract the needle. Now that our region of interest is sufficiently protected, we can begin removing material around it. We will use the ion beam at varying conditions to remove all material on either side of the protected area so that it may be removed from the bulk sample.
6:04
To do this, we use the piloting controls to designate areas where the ion beam will raster and remove material.
6:12
At first, we will remove a large area of material far away from our region of interest using a high current. Higher currents remove material rapidly. At high currents, even heavy metals like platinum will be removed by the beam and begin to destroy our target area which is why we don't want to be too close to the platinum cap at first.
6:32
Materials will sputter at different rates. Soft materials like polymers will be removed very quickly, whereas hard materials like metals will take a little longer.
6:44
As we get closer to the region of interest, we reduce the beam current to prevent damage to the region of interest as well as reducing the area to be patterned in order to save time.
6:54
Now that we have removed all the material around the platinum cap, we are ready to cut the specimen out of the bulk sample. We tilt the sample back to zero degrees so that the ion beam can cut underneath the region of interest.
7:07
Using the patterning functions, we draw the areas for the ion beam to mill out and sever it from the bulk sample leaving only a small area intact to keep it attached.
7:17
We will now use the omniprobe needle to lift the specimen out of the bulk material.
7:23
To do this, the omniprobe must be inserted through a separate control ware.
7:28
The omniprobe is basically just a very sharp needle.
7:31
It cannot simply grab the specimen. We must attach the specimen to this needle, and then cut the remaining material that keeps it attached to the bulk sample.
7:41
To do this, we position the needle over the specimen opposite the area where it's still attached.
7:49
Then we deposit platinum in a small area to glue it to the specimen.
7:54
Now that the specimen is secured to the needle, we use the ion beam to completely sever it from the bulk sample by cutting the section we left attached.
8:05
The specimen can now be transferred to the TEM grid.
8:10
Keeping the omniprobe stationary, we slide the TEM grid underneath it.
8:15
Then we bring specimen into contact with the TEM grid.
8:19
Now we attach it to the grid using platinum deposition similar to how we originally attach the omniprobe needle.
8:27
To complete the transfer, we use the ion beam to remove the remaining platinum that is still holding the specimen to the needle.
8:34
The omniprobe can be removed after this is complete.
8:39
Our specimen is on the grid, however it is not quite thin enough to be electron transparent.
8:44
A final thinning step using the ion beam at low current on each side of the specimen is necessary to make it thin enough. Now, the lift out is complete.
8:53
The specimen is now ready to be removed from the instrument and used in TEM experiments.
8:59
TEM sample preparation through ion milling is a very common application of ion beam and nanotechnology.
9:05
However, ion beam systems are very versatile and are increasingly being used in other creative ways to make nanoscale structures and patterns.
9:14
We can even draw pictures and patterns into a sample like the RTNN logo using an ion beam.
9:21
This concludes our demonstration of the TEM sample preparation and sample patterning using ion beams. Thanks for watching.
