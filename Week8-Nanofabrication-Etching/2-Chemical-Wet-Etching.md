### Basic Function
* Wet etching uses liquid etchings to remove undesired material. These etchings are often __strong acids__ or __bases__. 
* The substrates are placed directly into a bath containing an etching solution. The wafers are submerged in the bath, both sides of the substrate will be exposed to the etching and can be etched. 
* The exposed material is etched by chemical processes. The reaction products are typically soluble in the bath solution or gaseous. 
* As these are harsh chemicals, the user wears the appropriate personal protective equipment including; 
  + fume hood to protect themselves from harmful fumes. 
  + safety glasses, 
  + a face shield, 
  + chemical resistant gloves, and a 
  + chemical apron to avoid direct contact with etch chemicals. 
  
A chemical reaction between the reactant in the film etches the surface of the film. 
Depending on the reactant in the film, the reaction can be very __selective__, only etching the film. 

However, wet etching is __isotropic__ leading to pattern under-cutting. One common process uses the reactant hydrofluoric acid to etch the thin film silicon dioxide. 

* Buffering agents are also often added to etch solutions to maintain PH and keep a consistent chemical reaction over time. 
  + In the case of HF etching, ammonium fluoride is used as the buffering agent to prevent depletion of the floride ions and maintain PH. 

* The __etch rate can also be controlled__ to some degree by the user. For example, 
  + we can add more HF to increase the number of reactants that reach the surface. 
  + We can also increase the reaction rate by increasing the temperature. 
  + And we can remove the reaction products by stirring, which will also increase the reaction rate. 

* After etching, imaging by scanning electron microscopy or profilometry measurements should be conducted to validate the etching process. The sample should also be characterized prior to etching. 
Here, we can see a list of common material and etchant pairs for wet etching. 
It is important to consider all of the material components when you are selecting an etchant. For example, if you want to etch titanium and you are using photo resist as a protective layer, you may not want to select an etchant like hydrogen peroxide because it will also etch the photo resist. One of the main advantages of wet etching when properly done, is that it uses simple equipment. The process is straightforward and it also has high throughput. Wafers can be loaded into the container called the boat. Boats hold multiple wafers which allow simultaneous etching of several wafers at one time. Due to the chemical reaction that occurs during the etching, the process is highly selective. 
One of the main disadvantages of wet etching, is that the reactions in most cases are isotropic. This makes etching small geometries very difficult. It also requires large amounts of chemicals which can be costly to purchase and dispose of. The etchants used are also typically very dangerous chemicals. So safety can be a concern as users work directly with these chemicals. Further, find process control in these systems is difficult. This can make reproducibility hard. When selecting an etching process, It is important to take these pros and cons under consideration. This concludes our overview of chemical wet etching. Thank you for joining us today.
