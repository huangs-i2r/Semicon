### Transmission Electron Microscopy: Basic Function

Hi, I'm Toby Tung, a research scholar with the Analytical Instrumentation Facility or AIF at NC State. The transmission electron microscope or TEM, is a microscope that can give us nanoscale resolution images. This is possible because instead of using light for imaging, we use electrons. Electrons much like light can behave as waves. The wavelengths are much shorter than light on the order of one trillionth of meter or about one tenth of a diameter of an atom. Visible light has a range of wavelengths in the hundreds of nanometers or thousands of atomic diameters. It is these short wavelengths that enable imaging at the atomic scale. Here is TEM image of a metal alloy. Note that, we are able to resolve individual atoms. Since we are observing things at the atomic level it is very important to image in a controlled environment. Even small changes to the environment like vibrations from someone talking or an increase in temperature by one degree can affect imaging dramatically. Thus, TEMs are usually housed in basement rooms that have thick concrete walls or are on floating tables that will automatically compensate for any building vibrations. As you can see in this image, radiative cooling panels can be used to keep the temperature constant. Water flows through these panels to help control the rooms temperature. As the name indicates, in transmission electron microscopy, electrons travel through the sample. They will interact with the sample in different ways. Those that are transmitted and continue down the column can be used to generate an image. For this to occur, samples must be very, very thin. If samples are too thick the electrons will be unable to pass through. The necessary thickness is a function of the material itself and the type of analysis being performed. On average, samples should be less than 150 nanometers thick. Most of the time, samples are not at an appropriate thickness for to TEM. They must be processed in some way to generate a thin sample. We process samples in different ways depending on what they are and how the process will affect the sample. Ideally, the technique will minimally affect the sample itself or aspects of the sample that are under analysis. Here's a diagram of the TEM. At the top of the instrument is the electron gun. There are two types of methods to generate an electron beam. The first is thermionic emission and the second is field emission. With thermionic emission, the electron gun works similarly to an incandescent light bulb. A filament, the cathode, is the source of electrons. It is usually a hairpin shaped tungsten wire or LaB6 crystal. The filament is heated to a very high temperature and electrons boil off from its tip. Field emission guns use a sharp typically tungsten tip as an emitter with an applied voltage to extract electrons. This emitter generates more electrons than traditional thermionic emission guns. Both emission types have an anode located below the filament. The electrons accelerate from the cathode toward the anode to create an electron beam. Once the beam is generated it travels down the column. These electrons are at high energy around 80 to 300 KEV. Before imaging a sample, this beam is aligned to ensure optimal energy. The beam is focused using different lenses. These are not traditional light microscope or eyeglass lenses. These lenses are electromagnetic lenses and move the beam using magnetic fields. The electron beam also travels through a small opening or aperture, that helps focus the beam by blocking electrons that are off course. As the electrons travel through the sample, they will interact with it in a variety of ways. Some may be transmitted. Some may be scattered. In TEM we are typically concerned with the electrons that are transmitted. The transmitted electrons and the electrons energy gives us information about the sample and help generate the image. The transmitted electrons will travel through another set of lenses and apertures and be projected onto a phosphorescent screen. This screen produces photons when the beam hits it which allows us to see the sample. In order to capture an image of the sample, the screen must be removed so the electrons can be collected using a piece of film or digitally using a camera. Though TEM enables atomic scale resolution, it does have its drawbacks which are important to note. The TEM is a two-dimensional projection of a three-dimensional sample thus artifacts may be produced. It's often difficult to distinguish what is real from what is an artifact. For comparison, look at this image. It appears to show a two-headed rhino. It is obvious to us that this is an imaging artifact. However, in TEM these types of artifacts often exist and may not be so obvious. This can lead to a misinterpretation of results. To appropriately interpret results, complementary surface analysis technique should also be performed. In TEM only a small volume of the samples are imaged. Thus, it is important to ensure that the sample you are selecting for imaging is truly representative. This is another reason why it is best to supplement TEM experiments with other characterization techniques. In addition, aberrations or imperfections in the electromagnetic lenses lead to a distorted image. This makes it difficult to get clean crisp images at a high resolution. Luckily, many newer microscopes such as the analytical instrumentation facilities FEI Titan TEM have an aberration corrector. This type of advance and instrumentation makes collecting very high-resolution images possible. Speaking of the Titan, this microscope is also unique because of its ability to run in situ experiments. For example, researchers can change the temperature in the chamber to observe effects on the sample in real time. We continue to learn more about TEMs capabilities and new instrumentation techniques develop every day. Who knows, maybe one day we may be able to see things even smaller than we can now.


### Transmission Electron Microscopy: Sample Preparation Demostration
Hi, I'm Toby Tong, a research scholar with the Analytical Instrumentation Facility, or AIF, at NC state. Today we are preparing samples for transmission electron microscopy, or TEM. To do this, we'll visit Brianne Johnson, a graduate student in material science and engineering at NC State. She will show us how to conduct work in a sample preparation laboratory.
0:37
Remember, electrons must pass through the sample to generate an image. So the samples in TEM must be very thin, less than 150 nanometers. Because we have to use such a thin sample, and we only analyze a small part of it, we must make sure that the sample is truly representative.
0:55
This can be done by sampling larger areas using other analytical tools, like optical microscopy or scanning electron microscopy before we use TEM. To prepare samples from a bulk specimen, we can use various techniques, like ion beam milling, ultramicrotome, and mechanical polishing. In each of these techniques, we remove material until it is thin enough for the microscope.
1:20
Today we will be demonstrating mechanical polishing.
1:24
Here the samples are polished to a pre-defined height that can be controlled by the instrument. We will use the multi-prep instrument to polish the sample. In this technique, the sample is put into contact with a piece of lapping film.
1:37
A lapping film consists of a thin piece of plastic backing that has been coated with small particles of an abrasive material, like diamond or silicon carbide.
1:48
Lapping films are identified by grade, which describes the size of the abrasive particles. Today we'll be using a diamond lapping film with a grade of 15 micron.
1:59
First, we load the platen, which is coated with the diamond lapping film.
2:04
The diamond lapping film rotates in a circle, just like a record player, to remove material. The sample is placed in the sample holder.
2:13
Today we'll be polishing a sample of hafnium oxide. This material is often applied to other materials in a thin coat. It can act as an insulator.
2:23
We enter the desired thickness of the sample into the micrometer. We begin rotation of the diamond lapping film and turn on the chilled water.
2:31
During the polishing, the water will wash away the removed material and ensure the sample does not heat up. We bring the sample into contact with the diamond lapping film to start the polishing process. We monitor the thickness of the sample throughout the process using a micrometer.
2:48
Once we reach the desired thickness, we stop polishing.
2:52
Depending on the sample, multiple polishing steps and different grades of diamond lapping film may be required to reach the desired thickness.
3:01
In addition, samples for TEM are often polished into a wedge shape.
3:06
To make this wedge shape, the sample is brought into contact with the diamond lapping film at an angle.
3:12
This can reduce the time required for sample preparation and makes handling samples much easier.
3:19
The thicker part of the sample can be easily pick up and moved without damaging the thinner section, which will be imaged.
3:26
After polishing, the sample can be made even thinner using ion milling. Here ions, or charged particles, are generated from an inert gas like argon. They are then accelerated toward the sample and physically remove material.
3:40
The majority of samples must be mounted onto a TEM grid.
3:45
This grid provides structural support to the sample and allows for easy and safe handling of samples.
3:51
This grid is typically made of a metal like copper or molybdenum.
3:56
The grid has pores of a specific size. Again, because in TEM, electrons must pass through the sample, the pores are critical to allowing this. The pores range in size from 10s to 1,000s of microns. Grids are typically refered to by mesh size. The higher numbers indicate that there are more pores present and these pores are smaller.
4:18
A small mesh size signifies a larger pore size, in other words, fewer total pores.
4:26
The sample is mounted to the grid with glue.
4:29
The glue is applied around the edges of the sample to ensure that we do not image through the glue.
4:35
Once the glue dries, the sample is cleaned with a plasma cleaner.
4:39
This helps remove debris like dust or particles from the polishing process. After plasma cleaning, the sample is ready for imaging. If the sample is non-conductive, it may need to be coated with a conductive material like carbon.
4:53
If we have a sampling solution, the sample preparation is even simpler. Samples are pipetted directly onto a TEM grid and allowed to dry overnight. Here we are pipetting gold nanoparticles onto the grid.
5:06
Now those samples have been prepped, they are ready for imaging on the TEM.

### Transmission Electron Microscopy: Measurement Demostration
Hi, I'm Toby Tung, a research scholar with Analytical Instrumentation Facility, or AIF at N.C. State. Today, Rohan Dhall, a post-doctoral fellow with the AIF will demonstrate the Transmission Electron Microscope or TEM. This microscope can give us images at very high resolution. First, we load the sample mounted on a TM grid into the sample holder. The sample holder has a long rod that can reach to the middle of the column. We then plasma clean the sample to ensure we are not imaging dust or debris that could have collected on the sample. Plasma cleaning uses ionized gas, or plasma, to remove contaminants from the sample surface. We also always wear gloves to protect the sample from contamination. TEM must be performed in a very controlled environment. This room is actually a room inside a room. Thick concrete surrounds the room to prevent vibrations from affecting the instrument. Even small vibrations like someone talking can cause major changes at the atomic level. A change in temperature can also affect the sample. The radiative cooling panel seen here helped maintain the room at a constant temperature. This is the TEM. Let's briefly review the different parts of the microscope: At the top of the microscope is the electron gun, electrons will be accelerated down the column to form a beam, which is transmitted through the sample. This is the cold-trap, this trap or track contaminants that could enter the vacuum system and make it difficult to maintain the appropriate vacuum. This is necessary to enable the electron beam to travel the length of the column. If other molecules are present, electrons will interact with them and never reach the sample. We load the sample here, into the goniometer. This is a microscope stage that can move in the x, y, and z directions and can also rotate. This helps us control how the sample will interact with the beam. The electromagnetic lenses that help focus the electron beam are found inside this column. It is under vacuum. Here's where the image is projected. This phosphorus coated screen produces the signal that will allow us to see an image. Below the screen is the camera, that will capture the signal. To begin imaging the sample that we loaded, we first add liquid nitrogen into the cold-trap. When working with liquid nitrogen, we must wear special cryo-gloves to protect our hands from the very cold temperatures of the liquid nitrogen. Then we have to turn on the electron beam with an appropriate accelerating voltage. Next, we check some safety parameters of the instrument. We want to make sure that we have reached the appropriate vacuum and have an appropriate beam emission current, that is not too high or too low. Next, we align the beam. This is essential to obtaining a high resolution image. This is done by adjusting different microscope components. We can look here to see if the beam is aligned. If the beam is not aligned, we may see it wobble from side to side, or it may change diameter. After alignment, we can begin imaging our sample. The camera below the screen will collect the signal and send the information to the computer. As you can see, if we disrupt the environment say by clapping our hands, we can see the distortions in the atoms that are being imaged. That's how sensitive it is. On the computer monitor, we can see our sample and save the image for further analysis. Today, we are looking at gold nanoparticles. Here, we can see individual atoms. You must use a TEM to obtain this high of a resolution. We are also able to measure the size of a feature. Note the nanometer size of these particles. Rohan will continue collecting images from different regions of interest in the sample. This concludes the TEM demonstration. Thank you for joining us.
