## Learning Objective

- describe the basic e-beam lithography process
- explain key components of the EBL equipment and materials used
- describe conditions required for e-beam lithography

EBL uses spin coating, exposure, and development steps. But rather than using photo resist, EBL uses Electron Beam Resist or what we called EBL Resist, which is sensitive to electrons. Also, the exposure step of EBL doesn't involve light. But as the name implies, uses an electron beam instead.
