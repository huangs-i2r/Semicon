## Learning Objective

- define ionic species by their net charge
- name fabrication and analytical processes that use ion beams
- explain how an ion beam is generated
- recall important steps of TEM sample preparation with Focused Ion Beams
- estimate how thin a sample should be to be electron transparent by order of magnitude
- explain the relationship between beam parameters sputtering rate in ion beam systems


 If there are more positively charged protons than negatively charged electrons, the ion is called a cation, meaning it has a net positive charge. In the opposite case where there are more electrons than protons the ion has a negative charge and is called an anion.
