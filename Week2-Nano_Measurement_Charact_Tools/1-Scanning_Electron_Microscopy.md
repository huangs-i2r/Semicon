### Learning Objective

##### Scanning Electron Microscope: Basic Function, learners will be able to:

- identify advantages and disadvantages of using ESEM compared with traditional SEM
- contrast SEM images collected using backscattered electrons compared to SEM images collected using secondary electrons.
- compare electron microscopes with light microscopes

##### Scanning Electron Microscope: Sample Preparation Demonstration, learners will be able to:

- describe the basic process for preparing a sample for SEM. Samples are mounted on a sample stub prior to imaging

##### Scanning Electron Microscope: Measurement Demonstration, learners will be able to:

- describe the basic process for imaging a sample using SEM
- contrast SEM images collected using backscattered electrons compared to SEM images collected using secondary electrons
