### Cryo-Transmission Electron Microscopy: Basic Function
Welcome to the soft materials and cryo-TEM section of the nanotechnologies course. My name is Michelle Plue. In another video, we discussed how the Transmission Electron Microscope or TEM works and how to image hard material samples. In this lesson, we're going to talk about how to view soft materials using the TEM. How to prepare these types of samples, cryo-TEM and safety. We will then image soft materials and cryo-TEM samples. The first section of this video will cover what soft materials are and how to prepare them for the TEM. We will then discuss a little about cryo-TEM and how to prepare those samples. Soft materials are flexible substances like polymers, biological in nature, or are contained in a liquid. Some examples of soft materials are things like paper, fabrics, plants, animal tissue, plastics and cells. These samples range in size from tenths of nanometers, like a virus, to things that are many microns in size, like bacteria or cells, to things that are many millimeters in size, like fabric and paper. Bacteria are about 1,000 times larger than some viruses. One way to think about the difference in size between a bacteria and a virus would be like comparing a football field to a piece of notebook paper. In this case the size of the bacteria, which is our football field, is really only one tenth of the diameter of a human hair. The TEM is used to see the inside of soft materials. Have you ever seen a picture of a mitochondria or a nucleus? That was probably imaged with a TEM. To image the inside of samples, they must be prepared in very thin slices called thin sections. Thin sections of the samples are only 70 to 90 nanometers thick. To slice soft samples this thin, we must prepare them and harden them. Let's talk about preparing the soft samples to be imaged. There are a few different ways to prepare soft materials for imaging. One way to prepare them is to place them in epoxy resin. The samples that do not contain water like fabrics and paper, can be placed directly into the resin. Samples that contain water, like animal tissue or cells, must have the water removed before they can be placed in the resin. This process is called dehydration. To dehydrate the samples, we use a series of ethanol washes that replaces the water with the ethanol. Once we have reached 100% ethanol we can place the samples into the resin. The resin is then hardened in an oven. We use an instrument called an ultra microtome that has a diamond knife to make the thin sections. The thin sections are then placed on a TEM grid. These grids are then placed into the TEM for imaging. cryo-TEM is another way to prepare soft material samples. cryo-TEM is used when removing the water from the sample will change their shape or size. These changes are called dehydration artifacts. Sometimes, freezing samples will also give us better resolution. We can use the better resolution to do a 3D reconstruction of the sample. cryo-TEM involves freezing the sample that still has the water in it. There are different ways to prepare cryo-TEM samples. We will be talking about the plunge freezing method in this video. Plunge freezing quickly dunks the sample into liquid ethane or propane to freeze it. The reason we use liquid ethane or propane is because they are the right temperature to get the right type of ice to form. All ice is not equal. There are three different types of ice that can form at atmospheric pressure. Hexagonal ice, cubic ice, and vitreous ice. Hexagonal ice is the ice we see every day. It is the type of ice crystal that forms in an ice cube or a snowflake. Cubic ice is formed when vitreous ice warms up. I refer to that as bad ice when I see it in the TEM. Vitreous ice has no regular crystal structure and is called amorphous. This is the only type of ice that we can see through with the TEM. This is the good ice. Always wear the right type of safety gear when preparing samples. For biological sample prep, you will need to wear a lab coat, safety glasses and nitrile gloves. Liquid nitrogen is a cryogenic liquid. It freezes water almost instantly. Care must be taken when handling it. See what happens when this rose is put in to liquid nitrogen. When preparing cryo-TEM samples, you will need to change your gloves. Gloves become brittle when frozen and can freeze to your skin. Now we're ready to prepare our samples.

In this video, we will discuss sample preparation for soft materials in cryo TEM sample. Let's start with the soft material sample preparation. Today we are going to use a biological sample. This is a mouse liver. To start the sample preparation, biological samples need to be chemically fixed using formaldehyde. This process of fixing stops the sample from degrading. The sample is soaked in formaldehyde for at least two hours. All biological samples that come in to our lab are fixed ahead of time.
0:48
We will then stain the samples with heavy metals. This builds contrast in the samples so we will be able to see the membranes and other things inside the cell.
0:58
The next step is to dehydrate the samples. We wash it multiple times in ethanol. Each wash is an increasing percentage, starting with 30% and ending with 100% ethanol. Soft material samples are not hard enough to be thin sectioned. So once the 100% ethanol wash is complete, we add an epoxy resin. The samples are left in resin for at least eight hours. We usually let the sample soak overnight. We remove the sample from the resin and place it into a mold with brush resin. Next, we bake the sample in an oven for 48 hours to solidify the resin. Here's a prepared sample.
1:41
Remember that TEM means Transmission Electron Microscope. So that means the electrons pass through the sample to get an image. So the sample must be less than 150 nanometers thick for the electrons to pass through it. We will use a specialized instrument called an Ultra Microtome with a diamond knife to make the thin sections of the sample.
2:06
The microtome works by moving the sample over the diamond knife. The knife has a boat that is filled with water and after slicing, the thin sections float on the water.
2:20
The color of the thin section is a cue as to how thick the sample is. For a TEM, we want gold-colored sections. I'm going to put the section onto a grid, which we will take to the TEM for imaging.
2:39
Now I'd like to introduce you to Melanie O'Sullivan.
2:43
Melanie will be taking us through the cryo TEM sample prep and the cryo TEM imaging. >> Hi Michelle, let's get started.
2:52
Before I do anything, I need to put on a mask because my breath can warm up the liquid nitrogen in the sample. And the whole point of cryo TEM is to keep the sample frozen. First, I'll pour liquid nitrogen into the freezing chamber which is also called a jewer. We do this to lower the temperature in the jewer so that it will be cold enough to keep the ethane in liquid form. The ethane goes here in the center vessel. The liquid ethane temperature is between minus 140 and minus 180 degrees centigrade. When the vitro bolt plunges the sample into the liquid ethane, the sample freezes very quickly, and the vitribot holds the sample in the liquid ethane.
3:33
To start the process, we put the TEM grids onto the vitribot tweezers.
3:38
Then we load the tweezers into the vitribot. Next, using a pipet, we load the liquid sample onto the grid.
3:46
We have to take out as much water as possible from the sample. This process is called blotting, and we use absorbent paper to remove fluid from the sample. The vitribot does this for us, but we need to enter parameters that include drain time, blotting time, and angle of the blotting paper. The vitribot immediately plunges the sample into freezing liquid ethane after the blotting process. Now that our sample is frozen in the liquid ethane, we need to take it out of the ethane and transfer it to a gridbox. The sample is attached to the tweezers on the vitribot. So I'm going to take the tweezers and put the sample into a cold gridbox which is then put into a jewer that has liquid nitrogen in it.
4:24
We need to keep our sample frozen as we move it to the TEM for imaging.
4:29
Now let's go to the TEM room and load our sample into the TEM.
4:34
>> Now let's do some imaging. First, I'll show you how to image a thin section sample with the TEM. >> And then Iâ€™m going to show you how to image a sample by cryo TEM.
4:45
>> Here's our thin section sample on the TEM grid. We place the grid onto the sample holder. Remember that the TEM is always under vacuum, so we need to carefully insert the sample holder into the TEM. Then, we are going to optimize the beam to get the best images possible. Today, we are imaging a sample of muscle tissue. I am interested in looking at the mitochondria and Z bands in this muscle. So let's search for them.
5:15
This is our thinned sectioned image of our muscle tissue. This large black area here is our nucleus.
5:25
These smaller round objects are mitochondria. Notice that the mitochondria don't necessarily look like they do in a textbook.
5:34
The filamentous areas here, that is your actin and myosin filaments, and the dark black bands are the Z bands in the muscle. Now, let's go to Melanie for the cryo TEM imaging. >> Here's our frozen sample in the cold liquid nitrogen jewer. First, we cool off the cryo TEM sample holder, then we lay the sample into the holder.
5:58
>> To do this, we take the gridbox out of the liquid nitrogen jewer, and put it into the transfer station which also has liquid nitrogen to keep the sample cold. Then we take the grid out of the gridbox, and place the TEM grid into the cryo TEM sample holder. Then we put the cryo sample holder into the TEM.
6:18
Then we align electron beam and go looking around on our sample for a good spot to image. Today we are imaging a sample of polymersomes. Polymersomes are nanosized biodegradable polymer containers which we can load dyes or drugs into for the imaging and treatment of cancer in patients. Once I've made these polymersomes in a lab I need to check using cryo TEM that they're the correct size for optimal accumulation in tumors. >> Thank you for joining us today during this self materials in cryo TEM video.
