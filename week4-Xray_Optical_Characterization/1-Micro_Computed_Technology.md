### Micro Computed Tomography: Basic Function

Welcome to the micro CT video. I am Michelle Plue. I work in Duke University shared materials instrumentation facility. Micro computed tomography or micro CT allows us to see what a sample looks like both inside and out. We use x-rays to visualize differences in the density within a sample to produce a detailed 3D image or model. The x-rays do not damage or alter the sample. The micro CT is the same as a hospital CT or cat scanner. But this technique can achieve much higher resolution on small samples. First, let's talk a little about safety. The micro CT is an x-ray generating instrument. And x-rays can be dangerous, so the micro CT is shielded with lead. The lead shielding is also in this window so we can view our sample safely. An additional safety feature is that the x-rays cannot be produced when the door is open. Finally, x-ray safety training is required and regular safety inspections are made of the equipment. Because of all the safety features and protocols, no extra protective equipment needs to be worn when operating the micro CT. Now, let's discuss the operation of the micro CT. We will be using a USB drive as our sample. The micro CT generates x-rays by shooting electrons through a vacuum and hitting a tungsten target. These electrons interact with the tungsten to produce a cone of x-rays that shoot out toward the sample sitting on a central stage. When the x-rays reach the sample, some are absorbed by the sample and some are transmitted through to a detector.
2:16
The detector is like a digital version of film and sends the image information directly to the computer monitor.
2:26
Darker areas in the image are where x-rays are absorbed by the dense areas of the sample.
2:33
Brighter areas indicate regions where the x-rays pass through the sample.
2:39
However In the final reconstructed cross section images of micro CT data, this black and white color pattern is flipped so that white areas represent dense and black areas represent less dense material.
2:57
This is much like what you would see in an x-ray at a doctor's office.
3:02
Size is a limiting factor for the micro CT. Samples wider than 25 centimeters will most likely be too big to fit in the entire field of view of the CT scan. The stage that holds the samples in the micro CT spins around while the rest of the equipment stays stationary. This is unlike a CT scanner in a doctor's office where the machine wraps around a patient.
3:31
Because the stage spins, everything needs to be carefully positioned in order to stay in the field of view. A sample positioned close to the position of the origin of x-rays or target will have a better image resolution. Three to five microns is the maximum resolution possible by our micro CT.
3:53
Smaller samples allow for scans of much higher resolution as they are able to be positioned closer to the target.
4:02
This is comparable to shadows on a wall. The closer an object is to a light source the more magnified it will appear on the wall. Once we have a sample positioned on the stage, we can go into the software to adjust the x-ray energy, the exposure time and the sensitivity of the signal to get the best image possible. Thank you for joining me for this video on the basics of micro CT imaging.

### Micro Computed Tomography: Sample Preparation Demostration
Welcome back, I am Michelle Plue, in this video, we will discuss sample preparation for the micro-CT. The micro-CT can be used to image a wide variety of samples. Unlike many other procedures, it does not destroy the sample.
0:32
This makes the micro-CT a very useful technique to analyze samples that are very precious and rare.
0:41
In the next segment of this video, Ariana will be presenting. She is a graduate student at Duke University. Ariana will discuss her samples and show you how she prepares them for imaging on the micro-CT. >> Today, I'm scanning a number of fossil bones from ancient primate called omomyids. They were relatives of modern day monkeys, apes, and a primate group called the tarsiers. These fossils are for more than 50 million years ago and were collected in the Badlands of Wyoming by paleontologist from the University of California Museum of Paleontology.
1:17
Scientists are interested in studying these omomyidaes because they were one of the first true primates and studying their anatomy can tell us about what kind of animals they were and how they lived.
1:29
Studying ancient fossil primates can ultimately tell us about how primates separated and evolved from other mammal groups.
1:38
I scan the fossils in batches of many bones per scan.
1:42
I put many fossils into one of these small containers, essentially just empty pill caps and place up to four pill caps in a single straw.
1:51
Because each fossil bone comes with a unique specimen number used to track what it is and where it came from, it is important to make and create a careful map of the specimens before I pack them. The reason why we use pill caps and straws is because the specimens are very small and you want to get them packed in as tight of a space as possible. So that we can zoom in as close to the fossils while scanning.
2:16
These materials, in addition to the cotton used to surround the specimens, are all much lower density than the fossils which help them stand out during data processing. I also put many fossils in each straw because I have hundreds of fossils to scan and scanning them one at a time would not be very efficient.
2:37
This is another benefit to using the micro-CT. Large bat scans can be done without sacrificing the quality of any individual specimen.
2:46
Each pill cap with a fossil is filled with the cotton, which is used to keep the specimens separated from each other, and to keep them from shifting around during the scan.
2:56
Unintentional movements of the specimens while scanning will ruin the quality of the CT scan and make it blurry.
3:03
Each straw is then placed in a glass file with some clay around it. So that it's easy to position the straws right in the middle of the scanner stage.
3:12
The straw is held in place by the clay to reduce any vibration from the stage that might lead to unintended movement of the specimens.
3:23
>> Many types of samples can be analyzed in the micro-CT, not just bones and fossils.
3:30
Our instrument has been used to image USB drives, electronic circuits, museum specimens, marine species, plants, and meteorites. Sometimes, the samples need to be altered to get the best outcome with the micro-CT.
3:48
An alteration to a sample maybe as simple as taking them outside of any liquid in which they may be in, such as ethanol or formaldehyde. Removing the liquid component will help decrease the noise in the acquired images.
4:05
Because micro-CT creates images based on the density of the sample, very dense items such as rocks may not produce good images.
4:16
Removing any unnecessarily dense features of the sample, whether metal screws, rocky matrix, or thick packaging will also improve the scanning outcome. Similarly samples must have areas of different densities to produce good images. The best resolution is achieved when specimens are packed in a low density container that spins tightly around the center of the stage.
4:46
Orienting the longest dimension, up and down, keeps parts of the sample from being cut out of the field of view when the sample rotates around 360 degrees.
4:58
Opting to stain soft tissue samples with a solution of iodine, for example, can increase the level of detail detected by the micro-CT.
5:11
Here is an animation of a tree shrew from a museum collection. It is about 15 centimeters long.
5:19
This shrew has been treated with an iodine stain in order to perform a virtual dissection. Without ever cutting into the specimen, the researcher can visualize muscle and soft tissue details inside the shrew that are highlighted by the stain.
5:39
Thank you for joining me for this video on micro-CT sample preparation.

### Micro Computed Tomography: Measurement Demostration
Welcome to the image processing portion of the Micro CT video, I am Michelle Plue. CT scans produce large data files that can be up to 20-30 gigabytes in size. The first type of data that the Micro CT produces is the raw projection data. This data is a series of thousands of X-ray images taken around a single rotation of the specimen. Shown here is a video of thousands of X-ray projections for a honeybees scanned in the Micro CT. A computer then uses the projection data to reconstruct a final set of images that shows the three dimensional detail of the specimen. The reconstruction data comes in the form of a stack of TIFF or DICOM images that depict the sequential cross-sectional structures of a sample from top to bottom. This stack of images is also called a Z-stack. The Z-stack of the bee shows not only the external but also the internal anatomy of each cross-section. The Z-stacks can be used to virtually inspect, measure and illustrate the overall anatomy of the specimen. The Z-stacks are loaded into software where they can be visualized in 3D and specific ranges of gray values which represent different densities or materials can be labeled. These labels can then be turned into 3D models in animation. Here, a 3D surface is made of the exterior of the bee. If you were to digitally slice through this model you would still find all the internal anatomy depicted in the Z-stack. 3D models can then be sent to a 3D printer to create a physical representation of the original sample. 3D printed models can be scaled up for easy examination of the specimen and put on display without worry of damage to the original. Because of the nondestructive nature of the Micro CT and its ability to visualize structures that are otherwise difficult or impossible to see, it has become a popular tool in many fields of research. You've already seen some examples of a USB and its internal circuitry being examined, of animal muscles in skeleton's being scanned and fossils being digitized. The Micro CT can be used to illuminate delicate structures like the intrusions of roots in soil. The less dense materials like the roots cutting through the core are colored in blue while the more dense pebbles and dirt are in oranges and reds. The roots can also be isolated and studied as if they were suspended in air. The above examples are only a small slice of the types of research that use the Micro CT. Some other interesting applications include work on mummies, paintings, archaeological artifacts and much much more. Arianna will now show you how these different kinds of CT data are created for fossils samples. I used the Micro CT scanner to study these fossils because they were very small animals. Some of them were only the size of a mouse. Small animals have very small bones that are difficult to describe and measure using just a naked eye. They're also more difficult to handle and easy to lose track of which can be extremely stressful because fossils are irreplaceable. Using Micro CT scanner lets us make a digital copy of the fossil so that we can virtually manipulate it. We can blow it up to any size on the computer so that anatomical features can be more easily seen and measured. And the CT scans help us preserve an archivist fossils digitally in case a fossil is accidentally lost or broken in the future. After a specimen has been scanned and reconstructed, I use two programs to process and visualize the data. The first program I use is a free program called ImageJ where I crop the stack of scanned images to make the data set smaller and more manageable and so that I can separate out and better keep track of many fossils that I have included in the single scan. I do this by opening the tiff stack in ImageJ, selecting the area of interest until I think crop. I then save this new image stack with the specimen number in the file name. Next, I produce virtually reconstructed 3D surfaces of the fossils in the 3D visualization program Avizo. In Avizo, I open up the tiff stack to the images I just cropped in imageJ. I select the volume of interest using a specific tool in the program and do a smoothing steps to decrease the noisiness of the 3D model and produce high resolution surfaces for looking at on the computer or for 3D printing. Ultimately, I'll upload the scans in online repository for such data morphosource.org so that other researchers can look at the same specimens without ever having to pull a fragile original out of the museum tour.
