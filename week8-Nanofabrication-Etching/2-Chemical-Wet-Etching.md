### Chemical Wet Etching: Basic Function
* Wet etching uses liquid etchings to remove undesired material. These etchings are often __strong acids__ or __bases__. 
* The substrates are placed directly into a bath containing an etching solution. The wafers are submerged in the bath, both sides of the substrate will be exposed to the etching and can be etched. 
* The exposed material is etched by chemical processes. The reaction products are typically soluble in the bath solution or gaseous. 
* As these are harsh chemicals, the user wears the appropriate personal protective equipment including; 
  + fume hood to protect themselves from harmful fumes. 
  + safety glasses, 
  + a face shield, 
  + chemical resistant gloves, and a 
  + chemical apron to avoid direct contact with etch chemicals. 
  
A chemical reaction between the reactant in the film etches the surface of the film. 
Depending on the reactant in the film, the reaction can be very __selective__, only etching the film. 

However, wet etching is __isotropic__ leading to pattern under-cutting. One common process uses the reactant hydrofluoric acid to etch the thin film silicon dioxide. 

* Buffering agents are also often added to etch solutions to maintain PH and keep a consistent chemical reaction over time. 
  + In the case of HF etching, ammonium fluoride is used as the buffering agent to prevent depletion of the floride ions and maintain PH. 

* The __etch rate can also be controlled__ to some degree by the user. For example, 
  + we can add more HF to increase the number of reactants that reach the surface. 
  + We can also increase the reaction rate by increasing the temperature. 
  + And we can remove the reaction products by stirring, which will also increase the reaction rate. 

* After etching, imaging by scanning electron microscopy or profilometry measurements should be conducted to validate the etching process. The sample should also be characterized prior to etching. 
Here, we can see a list of common material and etchant pairs for wet etching.
* It is important to consider all of the material components when you are selecting an etchant. 
For example, if you want to etch titanium and you are using photo resist as a protective layer, you may not want to select an etchant like hydrogen peroxide because it will also etch the photo resist. 
* One of the main advantages of wet etching when properly done, 
  + is that it uses __simple equipment__. The process is straightforward and it also has high throughput. 
  + Wafers can be loaded into the container called the boat. Boats hold multiple wafers which allow simultaneous etching of several wafers at one time. 
  + Due to the chemical reaction that occurs during the etching, the process is highly selective. 
* One of the main disadvantages of wet etching, is that 
  + the reactions in most cases are __isotropic__. This makes etching small geometries very difficult. 
  + It also requires __large amounts of chemicals__ which can be costly to purchase and dispose of. 
  + The etchants used are also typically very __dangerous chemicals__. 
  + So safety can be a concern as users work directly with these chemicals. 
  + Further, find process control in these systems is difficult. This can make reproducibility hard. 
When selecting an etching process, It is important to take these pros and cons under consideration.

### Chemical Wet Etching: Demostration
Demonstrate chemical wet etching in the cleaner. Due to the nature of the chemicals that are used in the etching process and the potential exposure to these chemicals, safety precautions are of utmost importance. 

The process is conducted in a chemical fume hood. Air is drawn from the front side of the hood and expelled from the roof of the building. The facility exhaust has abatement systems in place to neutralize any reactive gases before released to the environment. The hood protects the user from harmful chemical vapors. On top of our normal clean room attire, we also wear appropriate personal protective equipment or PPE to prevent direct exposure to hazardous chemicals. This includes a chemical apron, chemically resistant gloves, and a face shield. 

To begin etching, we load the wafer into a boat. This boat holds up to 25 wafers, making batch processing easy. Today, we will be etching a silicon dioxide film that was deposited on a silicon wafer. The 100-nanometer film of silicon dioxide is protected in specific areas with a polymer film called photoresist. We can see the blue silicon dioxide film and the light brown photoresist pattern on top of it. 

Etching will take place in a bath of __buffered oxide etch__ or __BOE__. BOE is a mixture of hydrofluoric acid or HF, and a buffering agent, ammonium fluoride. 
  + The BOE we're using today is a 10-1 mixture of buffering agent to hydrofluoric acid. 
  + The etch process will take place due to a specific chemical reaction between HF and the silicon dioxide. 
  + The boat is lowered gently into the bath solution. 
  + The etch rate for this BOE mixture and silicon dioxide is known, and thus, we know how long to leave the wafer in the bath. 
* Today, the etch will take around three minutes. It's very important to do a __test etch with an extra sample__ to ensure correct etch timing. When three minutes has passed, we can remove the boat. As it is lifted out, the etchant will drain. One way we can monitor the etch process is by looking at the wafers. As the silicon dioxide is removed, the underlying silicon is exposed. 
The silicon surface is hydrophobic; it does not like water. If the silicon dioxide is etched, the etchant solution will wick away from the wafer quickly as it is lifted out of the bath. Thus, the exposed silicon part of the wafer will look dry. 

* The wafer must then be rinsed and dried. This can be done in a spin-rinse dryer. Before we move to the dryer, we first rinse the wafers in deionized water within the fume hood. We then retrieve the rack from the spin-rinse dryer and remove the top. We bring the rack to the fume hood and load it with wafers we want to rinse and dry. The rack containing the wafers is removed from the hood, we replace the rack lid and put the rack into the spin dryer. The spin dryer can accommodate 25 wafers at a time. We then close the door and start the process. The spin dryer will rinse the wafer with deionized water and dry it with nitrogen gas. This prevents contamination of the surface. The drying process will take about eight minutes. During this time, we can remove our chemical PPE since we are done working with the BOE. 

* Once the wafer is rinsed and dried, we can remove it from the spin dryer. Here is what the wafer looks like now after wet etching. Let's compare it to a wafer with a film of the silicon dioxide, like the one we put in the bath originally. Notice how the wafer has a blue color to it before etching. This is the silicon dioxide film. The blue color is gone after etching. 

* Since we used a wet etching process, both sides of the wafer were exposed to the bath and etched. 
To confirm that the thin film has been completely removed, it is also important to do __further characterization with electron microscopy, profilometry, ellipsometry, or reflectometry__.
